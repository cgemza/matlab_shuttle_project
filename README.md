# Hubble vs. Webb â€“ MATLAB Final Project

This MATLAB project, completed for **CSCI 1153 R02 (Fall 2023)** by Chelsea Gemza, uses symbolic calculus, data analysis, and curve fitting to explore the motion and structure of the Hubble and Webb Space Telescopes.

## Overview

The project is divided into three main parts:

### ðŸ”¹ Part A: Symbolic Math â€“ Hubble Launch
- Defines velocity, acceleration, and position of the Hubble Space Telescope as symbolic functions.
- Uses differentiation and integration to derive motion equations.
- Visualizes the functions over time using subplots.
- Compares Hubbleâ€™s estimated launch profile to the Webb Telescopeâ€™s.

### ðŸ”¹ Part B: Data Analysis â€“ Shuttle Components
- Loads part data from `shuttleparts.dat`, including weight, cost, and lifespan.
- Calculates total shuttle weight and center of gravity (before and after jettison).
- Uses dot product and user input to determine when each component will reach end of life.

### ðŸ”¹ Part C: Curve Fitting â€“ Launch Trajectories
- Uses polynomial fitting to model distance vs. time for Hubble and Webb.
- Compares their flight paths visually in side-by-side plots and combined overlays.
